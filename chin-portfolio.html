            <h3>From Code to Intelligence: My Journey as a Future Full-Stack & AI Developer</h3>
            <p>
                <time datetime="2025-01-12">January 12, 2025</time>
            </p>
            <p> 
                My interest in technology has grown from simple curiosity into a deep passion—especially in web development and artificial intelligence (AI). 
            </p>
            <p>
                I've come to believe that code is not just a technical tool, 
                but a bridge to solving real-world problems. This mindset has shaped my learning, 
                motivating me to master both frontend and backend development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently developing my full-stack development skills while studying how to apply AI in practice. 
                Courses like Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning have opened my eyes to data-driven decision-making, 
                intelligent automation, and predictive systems. 
                These experiences have inspired me to look toward a future where I can build technologies that not only work well, 
                but also make life easier and more meaningful for others. This is what I hope to achieve as a full-stack developer and AI engineer.
